# Task 2: Color / Pattern Grid Enhancements
## Objective: Add conditional presentation logic and parameter-driven display modes. Core Requirements:

- [ ] Extend previous grid: introduce a “mode” query param (e.g., single-color, palette-cycle, random).
- [ ] Palette-cycle mode rotates through a fixed list of visual styles (e.g., color themes).
- [ ] Display a small legend explaining modes. Constraints:
- [ ] Reuse the base layout structure (start factoring a base template if not done).
- [ ] Clean separation: color selection logic must not be hard-coded inline in multiple places. Stretch Ideas:
- [ ] Add a “shape” option (square vs pill vs rounded).
- [ ] Allow optional label suppression (just colors, no text). Reflection Prompts:
- [ ] What duplication emerged and how did you reduce it?
- [ ] How would adding more modes scale with current structure?
