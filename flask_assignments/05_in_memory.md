# Task 5: In-Memory To-Do List
## Objective: CRUD basics with POST/redirect and simple filtering using query params. Core Requirements:

- [ ] Add, list, and delete tasks (in-memory only).
- [ ] Each task has: id, title, creation timestamp, and status (pending by default).
- [ ] Query param filtering (e.g., status=pending). Constraints:
- [ ] No database yet; deliberate ephemeral design.
- [ ] Provide meaningful empty states (no tasks, filtered out). Stretch Ideas:
- [ ] Add basic priority levels with visual indicators.
- [ ] Implement simple search by substring (case-insensitive). Reflection Prompts:
- [ ] What are the drawbacks of in-memory storage?
- [ ] How would concurrency impact this setup?
