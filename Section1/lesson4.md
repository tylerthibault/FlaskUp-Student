# Lesson 4: Control Flow—Decisions and Loops in Python

In Lesson 4, you'll learn how to make your programs smarter by controlling how and when code runs. You'll use **if statements** to make decisions and **loops** to repeat actions—essential tools for solving real-world problems with Python!

## What You’ll Learn

### Making Decisions with If Statements
- What is control flow?
- How to use `if`, `elif`, and `else` to make decisions
- Using comparison operators (`==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`)
- Combining conditions with logical operators (`and`, `or`, `not`)
- Writing code that responds differently based on user input or data

### Repeating Actions with Loops
- What are loops and why use them?
- How to use `for` loops to repeat actions a specific number of times
- Looping over lists and ranges
- How to use `while` loops to repeat actions until a condition changes
- Common loop control keywords: `break`, `continue`, `pass`

### Practical Examples & Projects
- Filtering and processing data with loops and if statements
- Counting, searching, and summarizing information
- Mini project: Build a simple number guessing game or a program that analyzes a list of numbers

### Debugging & Good Habits
- Common mistakes with if statements and loops
- How to avoid infinite loops
- Using print statements to debug control flow
- Writing clear, readable decision-making code

### Building on Previous Lessons
- Combining functions with control flow for smarter programs
- Next steps: Using control flow to interact with users and process data

## Optional & Independent Research

- Nested if statements and loops
- List comprehensions for compact looping
- Practice reading official Python documentation for control flow and loops

By the end of Lesson 4, you'll be able to write Python programs that make decisions and repeat actions—key skills for creating interactive, useful applications!
