# Lesson 4: List/Dictionary Comprehensions and Lambda Functions

In Lesson 4, you’ll learn some advanced, but highly useful, features of Python that make your code more efficient and expressive. These tools are widely used in real-world Python code and will prepare you for object-oriented programming!

## What You’ll Learn

- **List Comprehensions**
  - How to quickly build lists using a single line of code
  - Filtering data with conditionals inside comprehensions
  - Examples: `[x*x for x in range(10)]`, `[word for word in words if len(word) > 3]`

- **Dictionary Comprehensions**
  - Build dictionaries in a compact way
  - Examples: `{x: x*x for x in range(5)}`

- **Lambda Functions**
  - What lambda (anonymous) functions are
  - Syntax and use cases for quick, one-off functions
  - Examples: `lambda x: x+1`
  - Using lambdas with `map`, `filter`, and `sorted`

- **Practice Challenges**
  - Write list and dictionary comprehensions based on real data
  - Use lambda functions with common built-in functions
  - Mini project: Filter and transform a dataset using comprehensions and lambdas

- **Recap & Tips**
  - When to use comprehensions and lambdas
  - How these features make your code more “Pythonic” and readable

---

## Optional & Independent Research

- **Set Comprehensions**
  - How to create sets using comprehensions
- **Advanced Lambda Usage**
  - Research combining lambdas with other built-in functions (e.g., `reduce` from `functools`)
- **Read Python Documentation**
  - Explore the official docs for comprehensions and lambda functions

Explore these topics on your own to deepen your understanding and become a more skilled Python programmer!
