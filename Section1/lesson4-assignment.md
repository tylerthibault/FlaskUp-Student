# Lesson 3 Assignment: Mastering Functions in Python

In this assignment, you'll practice writing, using, and testing functions—the most important building block for writing organized and reusable Python code. The problems below will help you understand how to define functions, use parameters, return values, and work with variables and data. All exercises are beginner-friendly!

---

## Part 1: Defining & Calling Functions

### Problem 1: Basic Greeting
Write a function called `greet` that takes a name as a parameter and prints a friendly greeting.  
*Example Output:*  
`Hello, Alice! Welcome!`

### Problem 2: Add Two Numbers
Write a function called `add_numbers` that takes two numbers as parameters and returns their sum.  
Call the function with different numbers and print the result each time.

### Problem 3: Default Parameter
Write a function called `say_hello` that takes a name parameter with a default value of `"friend"`.  
If no name is provided, it should greet `"friend"`.

## Part 2: Parameters, Arguments & Return Values

### Problem 4: Square a Number
Write a function called `square` that takes a number and returns its square.  
Test your function with at least three different numbers.

### Problem 5: Personalized Message
Write a function called `personalized_message` that takes two parameters: `name` and `age`.  
It should return a string like: `"Alice is 12 years old."`  
Print the returned message for at least two people.

### Problem 6: Multiple Return Values
Write a function called `get_min_max` that takes a list of numbers and returns both the smallest and largest number.  
Print both values when you call the function.

---

## Part 3: Local & Global Variables

### Problem 7: Local Variable Example
Write a function called `show_local_var` that creates a variable inside the function and prints it.  
Try to print the same variable outside the function.  
Observe and comment on what happens.

### Problem 8: Modifying a Global Variable
Create a global variable called `counter` and set it to 0.  
Write a function called `increment_counter` that increases `counter` by 1 each time it’s called.  
Call the function a few times and print `counter` after each call.

---

## Part 4: Working with Data in Functions

### Problem 9: List Processing
Write a function called `capitalize_names` that takes a list of names and returns a new list with all names capitalized.  
Test your function with a list of at least five names.

### Problem 10: Dictionary Message
Write a function called `describe_person` that takes a dictionary with keys `"name"` and `"age"` and returns a string like: `"Bob is 15 years old."`  
Test your function with two different dictionaries.

---

## Part 5: Writing Clear Functions

### Problem 11: Add Docstrings & Comments
Choose any function above and:
- Write a docstring describing what the function does, its parameters, and what it returns.
- Add comments to your code explaining the logic.

---

## Part 6: Testing Your Functions

### Problem 12: Test Your Work
Create a section at the bottom of your code where you call each function with different inputs to make sure they work as expected.  
Print the outputs for each test case.

## Completion Checklist

After finishing, make sure you can:
- [ ] Define and call functions with parameters and return values
- [ ] Use default parameters
- [ ] Understand the difference between local and global variables
- [ ] Pass lists and dictionaries to functions
- [ ] Write clear docstrings and comments
- [ ] Test your functions with various inputs
