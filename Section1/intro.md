# Section Overview: Getting Started with Python

In this first section of **FlaskUp**, you'll dive into the world of Python programming by learning the essential building blocks every coder needs. Weâ€™ll start from scratch and guide you through the basics, setting you up for success as you move toward web development with Flask.

## What You'll Learn

- **Getting Set Up**  
  Install VS Code and Python, and configure your coding environment.

- **Understanding VSCode and the Shortcuts**  
  Look at the common shortcuts in vscode that increase the speed at which you can code. 

- **Writing Your First Python Program**  
  Run your first lines of code and see instant results.

- **Variables & Data Types**  
  Store information and understand how Python handles different kinds of data.

- **Basic Operations**  
  Use math and other operators to work with numbers and text.

- **User Input**  
  Make your programs interactive by accepting input from users.

- **Conditionals**  
  Write code that makes decisions using `if`, `elif`, and `else`.

- **Loops**  
  Repeat actions efficiently with `for` and `while` loops.

- **Functions**  
  Organize your code and reuse logic by defining your own functions.

- **Lists**  
  Work with sequences of data using Python lists.

- **Mini Project**  
  Put it all together in a small, interactive Python program.


# Setup: VS Code & Python

## Step 1: Install Visual Studio Code (VS Code)
- Visit [https://code.visualstudio.com/](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
- Download and install the latest version for your operating system.

## Step 2: Install Python 3.13
- Go to [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- Download Python 3.13 (or the latest available version).
- During installation, be sure to **add Python to your PATH**.

## Step 3: Verify Your Installation
Open a terminal (or Command Prompt) and enter:
```sh
python --version
```
or
```sh
python3 --version
```
You should see output similar to:
```
Python 3.13.x
```
