# Lesson 4 Assignment: Decisions and Loops in Python

In this assignment, you'll practice making decisions in your code with if statements and repeating actions using loops. These exercises will help you write smarter, more interactive Python programs. All problems are beginner-friendly!

## Part 1: If Statements—Making Decisions

### Problem 1: Odd or Even
Write a program that asks the user to enter a number.  
Use an `if` statement to check if the number is odd or even and print an appropriate message.

### Problem 2: Number Comparison
Write a program that asks the user to enter two numbers.  
Use `if`, `elif`, and `else` to print which number is larger, or if they are equal.

### Problem 3: Grading System
Write a program that asks the user for their test score (0–100).  
Use `if/elif/else` statements to print:
- `"A"` for 90 and above
- `"B"` for 80–89
- `"C"` for 70–79
- `"D"` for 60–69
- `"F"` for below 60

### Problem 4: Age Group
Write a program that asks the user to enter their age.  
Print whether they are a Child (0–12), Teen (13–19), Adult (20–64), or Senior (65+).

## Part 2: For Loops—Repeating Actions

### Problem 5: Count to Ten
Use a `for` loop to print the numbers from 1 to 10.

### Problem 6: List Squares
Given a list of numbers `[2, 4, 6, 8, 10]`, use a `for` loop to print each number and its square.

### Problem 7: Sum a List
Write a program that uses a `for` loop to sum all the numbers in a list and prints the result.

### Problem 8: Filter Even Numbers
Given a list of numbers `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]`, use a `for` loop and `if` statement to print only the even numbers.

## Part 3: While Loops—Repeating Until a Condition

### Problem 9: Guess the Number
Write a program that sets a secret number (e.g., 7).  
Use a `while` loop to ask the user to guess the number until they get it right.  
Print a success message when they guess correctly.

### Problem 10: Countdown
Ask the user for a starting number.  
Use a `while` loop to count down to zero, printing each number.

---

## Part 4: Loop Control—Break and Continue

### Problem 11: Stop at Five
Write a `for` loop that prints numbers from 1 to 10.  
Use `break` to stop the loop if the number reaches 5.

### Problem 12: Skip Odd Numbers
Write a `for` loop that prints numbers from 1 to 10.  
Use `continue` to skip printing odd numbers.

---

## Part 5: Combined Challenge

### Problem 13: Simple Menu
Write a program that shows this menu until the user chooses "quit":
```
1. Say Hello
2. Add Two Numbers
3. Quit
```
- If the user picks 1, print `"Hello!"`
- If the user picks 2, ask for two numbers, add them, and print the result
- If the user picks 3, quit the program
- Use a `while` loop and `if` statements

## Completion Checklist

After finishing, make sure you can:
- [ ] Use `if`, `elif`, and `else` to make decisions in your code
- [ ] Write and use `for` loops to repeat actions
- [ ] Use `while` loops to keep repeating until a condition is met
- [ ] Use `break` and `continue` to control loops
- [ ] Combine decision-making and loops in a program
