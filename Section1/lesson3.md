# Lesson 3: Modular Programming & Error Handling in Python

In Lesson 3, you’ll learn how to organize your code into reusable pieces, handle mistakes gracefully, and write programs that are easier to test, debug, and share.

---

## What You’ll Learn

### Functions
- What is a function and why use them?
- How to call a function
- What are parameters and arguments?
- Using default parameters and named arguments
- **How to return values from a function**
- **Understanding local and global variables (scope)**
- **How to write helpful comments and docstrings for your functions**

### Importing Modules
- What modules are and why they matter
- Using Python’s built-in modules (`math`, `random`, etc.)
- How to install and use third-party modules with `pip`
- Creating your own modules
- **How to organize your code: keeping functions in separate files and importing them**

### Error Handling
- Why errors happen and how they affect your program
- Using `try`, `except`, and `finally` blocks
- Handling common errors (e.g., file not found, invalid input, `TypeError`, `ValueError`)
- Writing user-friendly error messages

### Practice & Testing
- Exercises importing and using modules
- Handling errors in simple programs
- **Testing your functions (try calling them with different inputs)**
- Mini project: Build a calculator app that handles user input errors

### Recap & Tips
- How modular code and error handling prepare you for larger projects
- Good habits for debugging and writing reliable code
- **Where to get help: Python documentation, Stack Overflow, online tutorials**

## Optional & Independent Research

- Exploring more modules such as `datetime`, `os`, `sys`, or `json`
- Try using modules from the Python Package Index (PyPI)
- Advanced error handling: custom exception classes and the `raise` statement
- Practice reading official Python docs for modules and error handling

By the end of Lesson 3, you’ll be ready to build Python programs that are easier to manage, test, debug, and share!
