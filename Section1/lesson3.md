# Lesson 3: Functions in Python

In Lesson 3, you’ll master how to break your code into reusable, reliable functions—the foundation for building readable and maintainable Python programs.

## What You’ll Learn

### Understanding Functions
- What is a function and why use them?
- How to define and call a function
- The difference between parameters and arguments
- Using default parameters and named arguments

### Return Values
- How to use `return` to get results from a function
- What happens when you don’t use `return`
- Returning multiple values

### Variable Scope
- Local vs. global variables
- How scope affects your code and avoids bugs
- Modifying global variables inside functions

### Writing Clear Functions
- Adding comments to explain your code
- Using docstrings to document what your function does, its inputs, and outputs
- Choosing clear, descriptive function names

### Working with Data in Functions
- Passing and returning lists, dictionaries, and other data types
- Converting and manipulating data inside functions

### Testing & Debugging Functions
- How to test your functions with different inputs
- Printing outputs and using assertions
- Common mistakes and how to fix them

### Practice & Projects
- Exercises for writing and improving functions
- Mini project: Build a set of useful utility functions (e.g., text formatting, math calculations, list processing)

### Good Habits & Next Steps
- Why functions make your code easier to debug, test, and reuse
- Tips for writing reliable functions
- Where to get help: Python documentation, Stack Overflow, online tutorials

## Optional & Independent Research

- Learn about lambda (anonymous) functions
- Explore built-in Python functions and how to use them
- Practice reading Python documentation for functions
