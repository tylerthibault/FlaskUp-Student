# Lesson 3: Modular Programming & Error Handling in Python 

In Lesson 3, you’ll learn how to organize your code into reusable pieces and handle mistakes gracefully. These skills help you write cleaner, safer, and more professional Python programs.

## What You’ll Learn

- **Importing Modules**
  - What modules are and why they matter
  - Using Python’s built-in modules (`math`, `random`, etc.)
  - How to install and use third-party modules with `pip`
  - Creating your own modules

- **Error Handling**
  - Why errors happen and how they affect your program
  - Using `try`, `except`, and `finally` blocks
  - Handling common errors (e.g., file not found, invalid input)
  - Writing user-friendly error messages

- **Practice Challenges**
  - Exercises importing and using modules
  - Handling errors in simple programs
  - Mini project: Build a calculator app that handles user input errors

- **Recap & Tips**
  - How modular code and error handling prepare you for larger projects
  - Good habits for debugging and writing reliable code

## Optional & Independent Research

- **Exploring More Modules**
  - Investigate other useful modules such as `datetime`, `os`, `sys`, or `json`
  - Try using modules from the Python Package Index (PyPI)
- **Advanced Error Handling**
  - Research custom exception classes
  - Explore how to use `raise` to create your own errors
- **Python Documentation**
  - Practice reading official Python docs for modules and error handling

Explore these topics on your own to deepen your Python skills and discover new tools!
