# Lesson 2: Working with Data in Python

In Lesson 2, you’ll expand your Python skills by learning how to organize, manipulate, and work with different types of data. These tools are essential for real-world programming and will prepare you for more advanced topics in future lessons.

## What You’ll Learn

- **Strings**
  - Indexing and slicing strings
  - Useful string methods (`split`, `join`, `replace`, `lower`, `upper`, etc.)

- **Numbers**
  - Different types: integers (`int`), floating point numbers (`float`)
  - Basic arithmetic operations (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `//`, `%`, `**`)
  - Converting between strings and numbers (`int()`, `float()`, `str()`)
  - Rounding and formatting numbers

- **Booleans**
  - The two boolean values: `True` and `False`
  - How booleans are used in conditionals and logic
  - The concept of "truthy" and "falsy" values (e.g., `0`, `""`, `[]`, and `None` are considered falsy; most other values are truthy)
  - Examples of how non-boolean values are interpreted in conditionals

- **Lists**
  - Creating and using lists
  - Accessing, modifying, and removing elements
  - List methods: `append()`, `remove()`, `insert()`, `pop()`, `sort()`, `reverse()`
  - Iterating over lists with loops
  - Using lists to collect and organize data

- **Dictionaries**
  - What dictionaries are and how to use them
  - Create, read, update, and delete dictionary items
  - Iterating over dictionary keys and values

- **Practice Challenges**
  - Exercises using dictionaries, strings, lists, and booleans
  - Mini project: Example—count word frequency in a text file

- **Recap & Tips**
  - Best practices for organizing and handling data
  - How these data structures prepare you for larger projects

## Optional & Independent Research

- **Tuples and Sets**
  - Understanding tuples and their immutability
  - When to use a tuple vs a list
  - Sets and why uniqueness matters
  - Common tuple and set operations

Explore these topics on your own to deepen your understanding of Python’s data structures!
