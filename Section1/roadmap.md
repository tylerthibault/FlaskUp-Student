# Roadmap: Python Lessons 1–4

This roadmap outlines your journey through the first four Python lessons. Each lesson builds key programming skills, introduces essential concepts, and prepares you for more advanced work. Practice projects and challenges are integrated to reinforce each topic.

---

## Lesson 1: Python Basics

**Goals:**
- Run your first Python program (`print("Hello, world!")`)
- Learn about variables, types, and basic operations
- Get input from users and use conditionals (`if`, `else`)
- Master loops (`for`, `while`)
- Write and use simple functions
- Work with lists to store and manipulate data

**Milestone Project:**  
Create a program that greets the user and calculates their age in 10 years.

**Practice & Challenges:**  
- Predict and test basic math operations
- Describe and code a real-life loop
- Write a function that adds two numbers

---

## Lesson 2: Working with Data

**Goals:**
- Manipulate strings (indexing, slicing, methods)
- Work with numbers (types, conversion, formatting)
- Understand booleans and truthy/falsy values in logic
- Use lists for organizing and iterating over data
- Create and use dictionaries for key-value data storage

**Milestone Project:**  
Write a program to count word frequency in a text file.

**Practice & Challenges:**  
- Use and combine list and dictionary methods
- Explore how non-boolean values affect conditionals
- Try manipulating and printing data in different formats

**Optional:**  
- Learn about tuples and sets, and their uses

## Lesson 3: Modular Programming & Error Handling

**Goals:**
- Import and use Python’s built-in and third-party modules
- Organize code into reusable modules
- Handle errors with `try`, `except`, and `finally`
- Write user-friendly error messages and validations

**Milestone Project:**  
Build a calculator that handles invalid user input gracefully.

**Practice & Challenges:**  
- Write your own module and import it
- Handle file reading errors and user input errors

**Optional:**  
- Explore more modules (`datetime`, `os`, `json`)
- Research custom exception classes and using `raise`

---

## Lesson 4: List/Dictionary Comprehensions & Lambda Functions

**Goals:**
- Use list comprehensions for concise data processing
- Build dictionaries with dictionary comprehensions
- Write and use lambda (anonymous) functions
- Integrate lambdas with functions like `map`, `filter`, and `sorted`
- Make your code more “Pythonic” and efficient

**Milestone Project:**  
Filter and transform a dataset using comprehensions and lambdas.

**Practice & Challenges:**  
- Write comprehensions with conditions
- Use lambdas for quick operations on lists/dictionaries

**Optional:**  
- Create set comprehensions
- Explore advanced lambda functions and use with `functools.reduce`

---

## Progression & Integration

- Each lesson builds on the last; revisit previous projects to apply new concepts.
- Practice challenges encourage experimentation and deeper understanding.
- Optional research topics help you explore beyond the basics.
